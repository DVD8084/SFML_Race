# SFML_Race
This is a simulation of a generic racetrack game that you might have played on paper before.
First, the two players put their dots on any intersection on the starting line (the bottommost line) of the road (between the two road borders).
Each turn, a player can change their vector of movement by one cell in any direction (including diagonals). This allows them to change their speed with fixed acceleration.
The objective of the game is to arrive at the finish line (topmost line) first without going off the road. A player who got off the road has to skip every other turn until they get back on track.
Keep in mind that this is mostly a test project, so a lot of things (such as checking if a player had gone off the road) are not implemented.
In case someone needs to skip a turn, they'll need to do it manually by using the right mouse button.

This is a test project, made using SFML.
